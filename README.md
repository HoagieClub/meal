## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

```bash
brew install bun

### Installation

To install the necessary dependencies, run:

```bash
bun install
```

### Running the App

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server by running in the `frontend/` directory:

bun run dev
```

The app will now be running locally, and you can view it in your browser at localhost:3000.

### Backend
